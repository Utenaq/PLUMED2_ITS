# PLUMED2_ITS
The integrated tempering sampling (ITS) method as a bias in PLUMED2.

This project only includes the basic code of ITS method. Please download PLUMED2 from website http://www.plumed.org/
 
This problem is based on PLUMED 2.4, and it could also be used with PLUMED 2.3. 

All the codes are in the src/bias directory. In order to use the ITS method, please copy them to the (plumed_path)/src/bias
directory and recompile PLUMED2.

You can also download the merged full version of PLUMED 2 in my project helloyesterday/plumed2 with the branch "ver_isaac". That branch includes all the modified function of PLUMED2 at my GitHub account.
